This repository aims at creating an API connection from a local host server to authorised users. The flask server will collect the data in the request format (attached request.json) and return the response in the response format (attached response.json).
This API performs a task of getting preliminary results and then computing KNN results from the pickled models. The final results are then fed to Open AI API call to get the summary.
